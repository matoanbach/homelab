## Multiple Provider Configuration
- There can be a requirement that multiple resource types in the same TF file need to be deployed in separate regions.
- By using the provider meta-argument, you can select an alternate provider configuration for a resource.

```
provider "aws" {
    region = "ap-southest-1"
}

provider "aws" {
    alias = "mumbai"
    region = "ap-south-1"
}

provider "aws" {
    alias = "usa"
    region = "us-east-1"
}
```

```
resource "aws_instance" "myec2" {
    provider = aws.mumbai
    ami = "ami-..."
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_security_group" "allow_tls" {
    provider = aws.usa
    name = "staging_firewall"
}
```

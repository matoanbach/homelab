## Standard Module Structure
- At this stage, we have been keeping the overall module structure very simple to understand the concepts.
- In production environments, it is important to follow recommendations and best-practice set by HashiCorp.
- The **standard module structure** is a file and directory layout HashiCorp recommends for reusable modules.
- A minimal recommended module following the standard structure is shown below:
```
|
|_ README.md
|_ main.tf
|_ variables.tf
|_ outputs.tf
```

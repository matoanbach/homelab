# Terraform Workspace
- An infrastructure created through Terraform is tied to the underlying Terraform configuration and a state file.
- What if we have multiple state file for single Terraform configuration?
- Can we managae different envs through it separately?
- Terraform workspace enable us to manage multiple set of deployments from the same sets of configuration file
- Depending on the workspace being used, the value to a specific argument in your terraform code can also change.
- `terraform workspace list`

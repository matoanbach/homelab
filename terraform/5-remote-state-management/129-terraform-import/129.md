## Terraform Import
- It can happen that all the resources in an organization are created manually.
- Organization now wants to start using Terraform and manage these resources via Terraform.

## Earlier Approach
- In the older approach, Terraform import would create the state file associated with the resources running in your environment.
- Users still had to write the tf files from scratch.

## Newer Approach
- In the new approach, `terraform import` can automatically create the terraform configuration files for the resources you want to import.

## Notes
- `Terraform 1.5` introduces automatic code generation for imported resources
- This dramatically reduces the amount of tim you need to spend writing code to match the import
- This feature is not available in the older versions of Terraform.

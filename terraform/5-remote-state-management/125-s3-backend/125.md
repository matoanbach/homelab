# S3 Backend
- The S3 backend allows Terrafom to store state file in a specific S3 bucket.
- Note: Terraform should have required access to the S3 bucket to be able to push and pull state file to/from S3 bucket.
```
terraform {
    backend "s3" {
        bucket = "lab"
        key = "terraform.tfstate"
        region = "us-east-1"
        use_lockfile = true
    }
}
```
- It is highlt recommended that you enable Bucket Versioning on the S3 bucket to allow for state recovery in the case of accidental deletions and human error.

# Remote State Data Source
- In larger enterprises, there can be multiple different teams working on different aspects of an infrastructure resource.

## Challenge
- Security Team wants that all the IP addresses added as part of Output Values in tfstate file of Networking Team project should be whitelisted in Firewall.

## What needs to be achieved
- The code from Security Team project should connect to the terraform.tfstate file managed by the Networking team.
- The code should fetch all the IP addresses mentioned in the output values in the state file.
- The code should whitelist these IP addresses in Firewall rules.

## Practical Workflow Steps
1. Create two folders for networking-team and security-team
2. Create Elastic IP resource in Networking Team and store the state file in S3 bucket. Output values should have information of EIP.
3. In Security Team, use Terraform Remote State data source to connect to the tfstate file of Networking Team.
4. Use the Remote State to fetch EIP and whitelist it in Security Group rule.

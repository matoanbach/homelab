# State Locking
- Running `terraform apply` simultaneously by multiple team members on same project can cause Terraform to make concurrent changes to the state file. This can result in state file corruption and inconsistencies.
- State locking is a machanism that prevents multiple operations from making concurrent changes to your infrastructure state file, which could lead to corruption or inconsistent state.

## Process of State Locking
- Before performing any write operation, Terraform attempts to acquire a "lock" on the state file.
- If the lock is successfully acquired, Terraform proceeds with the operation.
- Once the operation is complete, Terraform releases the lock, allowing other processes to acquire it.

## State Locking with Local Backend
- If using local state (local backend), Terraform uses a `.lock` file in the working directory for locking.
- When a state lock is held, any attempt by another process to operate will fail with an error.

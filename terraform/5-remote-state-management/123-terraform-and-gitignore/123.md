## Terraform and Gitignore
- The `.gitignore` file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project.

| .gitignore  |
|-------------|
| conf/       |
| *.artifacts |
| credentials |

- Depending on the environments, it is recommended to avoid committing certain files to GIT.

|Files to Ignore| Description |
|-|-|
|`.terraform`| This file wil be recreated when `terraform init` is run|
|`terraform.tfvar`|Like to contain sensitive data like usernames/passwords and secrets|
|`terraform.tfstate`|Should be stored in the remote side|
|`crash.log`|If terraform crashes, the logs are stored to a file named crash.log|

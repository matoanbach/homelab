# Terraform Troubleshooting Model
- There are four potential types of issues that you could experience with Terraform: Language, State, Core, and Provider Errors.
## Language Errors
- In most of the cases, the errors that will be related to this.
- When Terraform encounters a syntax error in your configuration, it prints out the line numbers and an explanation of the error.

## State Errors
- If state is out of sync, Terraform may destroy or change your existing resources.
- If state is locked, you will also be blocked from running write operations.

## Core Errors
- These errors are directly related to the main Terraform application.
- Errors produced at this level may be a bug.

## Provider Errors
- These set of errors are primarily related to the provider plugins.
- Use the Provider Github page for reporting and identifying the issue.

## Typical Challenge
- It can happen that in a single terraform file, you are defining two different resources.
- However Resource 2 might be dependent on some value of Resource 1.

## Understanding The Workflow
```
resource "aws_eip" "lb" {
    domain = "vpc"
}

resource "aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule" "allow_tls_ipv4" {
    security_group = aws_security_group.allow_tls.id
    cidr_ipv4 = "${aws_eip.lb.public_ip}/32"
    from_port = 80
    ip_protocol = "tcp"
    to_port = 80
}
```

## Dynamic Block
- In many use cases, there are repeatable nested blocks that needs to be defined.
- This can lead to a long code and it can be difficult to manage in the future.
- Dynamic Block allows us to dynamically construct repeatable nested blocks which are supported inside resource, data, provider, and provisioner blocks:
```
resource "aws_security_group" "dynamicsq" {
    name = "dynamic-sg"
    description = "Ingress for Vault"
    
    dynamic "ingress" {
        for_each = var.sq_ports
        content {
            from_port = ingress.value
            to_port = ingress.value
            protocol = tcp""
            cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
        }
    }
}
```

### Iterators
- The interator argument (optional) sets the name of a temporary variable that represents the current element of the complex value.
- If omitted, the name of the variable defaults to the label of the dynamic block ("ingress" in the example above)

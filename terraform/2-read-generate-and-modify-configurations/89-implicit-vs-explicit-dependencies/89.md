## Implicit vs Explicit Dependencies
### Explicit Dependency
- Explicit dependencies are declared using `depends_on` argument
- You use this when there's no direct attribute reference, but you still need to control the order of resource creation

### Implicit Dependency
- Since in `aws_instance` resource there is a reference to the ID of the `aws_security_group` resource, terraform automatically understands that the security group must be created before the EC2 instance.
```
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
    ami = "ami-01dk10wd1dw0"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.prod.id]
}

resource "aws_security_group" "prod" {
    name = "production-sg"
}
```

## Terraform Settings
- We can use the provider block to define various aspects of the provider, like region, credentials and so on.
```
provider "aws" {
    region = "us-east-1"
    access_key = "ADMADSDASDSD"
    secret_key = "asdakjsdnasojdasldnaldas"
}

resource "aws_security_group" "sg_01" {
    name = "app_firewall"
}
```

## Specific version to run your code
- In a terraform project, your code might require a very specific set of versions to run
- For example, a sample terraform code requires the following:
    - Terraform Version must be 1.8
    - AWS Provider Version must be 5.56

## Introducing Terraform settings
- Terrafrom settings are used to configure project-specific Terraform behaviors, such as requiring a minimum terraform version to apply to your configuration.
- Terraform settings are gathered together into a `terraform` block:

```
terraform {
    # <setting 1>
    # <setting 2>
}
```

### Specifying a required terraform version
- If your code is compatible with specific versions of terraform, you can use the `required_version` block to add your constraints
```
terraform {
    required_version = "1.8"
}
```

### Specifying provider requirements
- The `required_providers` block can be used to specify all of the providers required by your Terraform code.
- You can further fine-tune to include a specific version of the provider plugins.
```
terraform {
    required_providers {
        aws = {
            version = "5.56"
            source = "hashicorp/aws"
        }
    }
}
```

### Flexibility in setting block
- There are many options that can be specified in the `terraform` block:
    - required terrafomr verion
    - required provider and version
    - back-end configuration
    - experimental features

### Notes
- It is a good practice to include the `terraform` block to include details like `required_providers` as part of your project.
- The `provider` block is still important to specify various other aspects like regions, credentials, alias and others.

## Basics of Attributes
- Each resource has its associated set of attributes
- Attributes are the fields in a resource that hold the values that end up in state.
| Attributes  | Values                    |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| ID          | i-abcd                    |
| public_ip   | 52.74.32.50               |
| private_ip  | 172.31.10.50              |
| private_dns | ip-172-10-50.ec2.internal |

## Notes
- Each resource type has a predefined set of attributes determined by the provider.

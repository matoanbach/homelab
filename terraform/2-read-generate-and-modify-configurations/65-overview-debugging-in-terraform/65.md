## Debugging
- Debugging os the process of finding the root cause of a specific issue.
### Verbosity
- Similar to SSH Verbosity, even Terraform allows us to set wide variety of log levels for getting detailed logs for debugging purpose.
- Terraform has detailed logs that you can enable by setting the `TF_LOG` environment variable to any value
- You can set `TF_LOG` to one of the log levels (in order of decreasing verbosity)
| Log level |
|-----------|
| TRACE     |
| DEBUG     |
| INFO      |
| WARN      |
| ERROR     |
- To persist logged output you can set `TF_LOG_PATH` in order to fource the log always be appended to a specific file when logging is enabled.

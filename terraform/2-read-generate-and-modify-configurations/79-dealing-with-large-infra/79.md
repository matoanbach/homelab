# Dealing with Larger Infrastructure
##  Convert big project to multuple smaller projects
- Whenever you are designing a terraform project, you have to keep in mind the API limits of the provider to avoid throttling that will further impact production systems.

## Use resource targeting
- Using resource targeting, the number of calls that will be made to a provider will be much less
- `terraform plan -target aws_ec2.prod`

## Setting `refresh=false`
- The `refresh=false` option is used in normal planning mode to skip the default behavior of refreshing terraform state before checking for configuration changes.
- By disabling automatic refresh, you can potentially speed up the planning and application process, especially if you're confident that the existing state is accurate.

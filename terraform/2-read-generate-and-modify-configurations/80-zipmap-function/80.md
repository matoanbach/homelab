# zipmap
- The zipmap function constructs a map from a list of keys and corresponding list of values.
- An example is shown below:
    ```
    zipmap(["pinapple", "oranges", "strawberry"], ["yellow", "orange", "red"])
    {
        "orange" = "orange"
        "pinapple" = "yellow"
        "strawberry" = "red"
    }
    ```

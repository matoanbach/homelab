## Use case
- you have created a new resource via Terraform.
- users have made a lot of manual changes (both infrastructure and inside the server)
- two ways to deal with this: Import Changes to Terraform / Delete & Recreate the resource.

## Recreating the Resource
- The `-replace` option with `terraform apply` to force Terraform to replace an object even though there are no configuration changes that would require it.

- `terraform apply -replace="aws_instance.web"`

## Notes
- Similar kind of functionality was achieved using `terraform taint` command in older versions of Terraform.
- For Terraform v0.15.2 and later, HashiCorp recommend using the `-replace` option with `terraform apply`

## Resource dependencies
- The `depends_on` argument tells Terraform to complate all actions on the dependency object before preforming actions on the object declaring the dependency.
## Example
```
resouce "aws_instance" "example" {
    ami = "ami-01d129010j0d11"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.example]
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
    bucket = "lab-demo-s3-bucket-007"
}
```

- The `depends_on` argument explicitly tells Terraform the aws_instance.example must be created after aws_s3_bucket.example
- When you run `terraform destroy`, the order is reversed to ensure dependencies are not broken during deletion.

# Output Values
- `Output Values` make information about your infrastructure available on the command line, and can expose information for other Terraform configurations to use
- For example, we craete an Elastic IP (Public IP) resource in AWS and output the value of the EIP.

## Notes
- Output values defined in Project A can be referenced from code in Project B as well.

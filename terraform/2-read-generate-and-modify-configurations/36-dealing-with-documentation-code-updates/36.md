# Documentation Challenge
- Occasionally oin the newer version of providers, you will see some changes in the way you create a resource

## Points to Node
- Just because a better approach is recommended, does NOT always mean that the older approach will stop working.
- Organizations can continue to use the approach that suits best in its environment.
- You can always switch to the older version of provider documentation page to understand the changes

## Closing Pointers
- For larger enterprise, it becomes difficult to upgrade their code base to the newer approach that provider recommends.
- In such case, they stick with the approapriate provider version that supports the older approach of creating the resource.

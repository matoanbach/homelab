## Challange
- Various resources in your project can have common values like tags.
- Repeating these values across multiple resource blocks increases the code length and makes it difficult to manage in larger projects.
## Local Variables
- Local values are similar to variables in a sense that it allows you to store data centrally and that can be referenced in multiple parts of configuration.
```
locals {
    comman_tags = {
        Team = "payments-team"
    }
}

resource "aws_instance" "myec2" {
    ami = "ami-..."
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    tags = local.common_tags
}

resource "aws_security_group" "allow_tls" {
    name = "firewall_sg"
    tags = local.common_tags
}
```
- You can add expressions to locals, which allows you to compute values dynamically
```
locals {
    # Ids for multiple sets of EC2 instances, merged together
    instance_ids = concat(aws_instance.blue.*.id, aws_instance.green.*.id)
}

locals {
    # Common tags to be assigned to all resources
    common_tags = {
        Service = local.service_name
        Owner = local.owner
    }
}
```

## Locals vs Variables
- Variables can be defined in many places like `terraform.tfvars`, ENV, Variables, CLI and so on.
- Locals are more like a private resource. You have to directly modify the code.
- Locals are used when you want to avoid repeating the same expression multiple times.

## Notes
- Local values are often referred to as just `locals`
- Local values are created by a `local` block (plural), but you reference them as attributes on an object named `local` (singular)

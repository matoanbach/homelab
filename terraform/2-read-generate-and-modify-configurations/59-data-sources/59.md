# Data Sources
- Data sources allow Terraform to use / fetch information defined outside of Terraform
- Following data source code is used to get information on your DigitalOcean account.

## Usage Example
- Following data source code is used to get information on your DigitalOcean account
```
data "digitalocean_account" "example" {}
```
- Following data source allows to read contents of a file in your local filesystem. `${path.module}` returns the current file system path where your code is located.
```
data "local_file" "foo" {
    filename = "${path.module}/demo.txt"
}
```
- Following data source code is used to fetch details about the EC2 instance in your AWS region.
```
data "aws_instances" "example" {}
```
## Format
- A data source is accessed via a special kind of resource known as a data resource, declared uing a data block
- Following data block requests that Terraform read from a given data source ("aws_instance") and export the result under the given local name ("foo")
```
data "aws_instance" "foo" {}
```

## Filter Structure
- Within the block body (between `{` and `}`) are query constraints defined by the data source.
```
data "aws_instance" "foo" {
    filter {
        name = "tag:Team"
        values = ["Production"]
    }
}
```

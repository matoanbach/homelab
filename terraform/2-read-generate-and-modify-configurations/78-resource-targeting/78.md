# Resource Targeting
- In a typical Terraform workflow, you apply the entire plan at once. This is also the default behavior.
- Resource targeting in Terraform allows yoi to apply changes to a specific subset of resources rather than apply changes to your entire infrastructure.
- You can use `-target` option to target specific resources, modules as part of operation
    - `terraform plan -target local_file.foo`

## Use cases
- A project has 10 resource. Multiple team members are working on each resource's Terraform code to release some updates.
- When you run terraform plan, you see Terraform trying to make changes to all 10 resources.
- There is a critical issue and you need to add a port 80 in security group that is managed via terraform without having to update other 9 resources.

## Notes
- Occasionally you may want to apply only part of a plan, such as when Terraform's state has become out of sync with your resources due to a network failure, a project with the upstream cloud platform, or a bug in Terrafrom or its providers.
- To support this, Terraform lets you target specific resources when you plan, apply, or destroy your infrastructure.
- Targeting individual resources can be useful for troubleshooting errors, but should not be part of your normal workflow.

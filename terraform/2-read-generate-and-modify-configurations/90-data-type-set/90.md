## SET
- Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
- These items can be duplicates as well.
- List items are indexed
- Sets can only store unique elements
- Any duplicates are automatically removed.
### Notes
- Whole defining a SET, you need to also define the type of value that is expected.
```
variable "my-set" {
    type = set(string)
}
```

## SET is Unordered
- A set does not store the order of the elements
- Terraform only tracks the presence of elements, not their order.
- If the elements in a set change order, terraform won't detect that as a change. However, if an element is added or removed, terraform will aplly updates accordingly.

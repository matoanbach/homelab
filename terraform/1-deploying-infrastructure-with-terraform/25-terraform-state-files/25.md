## Terrafrom State File
- Terraform stores the state of the infrastructure that is being created from the TF files.
- This state allows terraform to map real world resource to your existing configuration.

## Desired and Current State
### Desired State
- Terraform's primary function is to create, modify, and destroy infrastructure resources to match the desired state described in the Terraform configuration file.

### Current State
- Current state is the actual state of a resource that is currently deployed.

### Important Pointer
- Terraform tries to ensure that the deployed infrastructure is based on the desired state.
- If there is a difference between the two, terraform plan presents a description of the changes necessary to achieve the desired state.

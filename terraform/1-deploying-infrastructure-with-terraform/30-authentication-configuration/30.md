## Authentication without exposing the sensitive keys
- At this stage, we have been manually hardcoding the access / secret keys within the provider block.
- Although a working solution, but it is not optimal from security point of view.

## What we want
- We want our code to run successfully without hardcoding the secrets in the provider block.
```json
provider "aws" {
    region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_eip" "lb" {
    domain = "vpc"
}
```

## Better Approach 
- The AWS Provider can source credentials and other settings from the shared configuration and credential files.
```json
provider "aws" {
    shared_config_files = ["..."]
    shared_credentials_files = ["..."]
    profile = "customprofile"
}

resource "aws_eip" "lb"  {
    domain = "vpc"
}
```

## Default Configurations
- If shared file lines are not added to provider block, by default, Terraform will locate these files at `$HOME/.aws/config` and `$HOME/.aws/credentials` on Linux and MacOS.

## AWS CLI
- AWS CLI allows customers to manage AWS resources directly from CLI.
- When you configure Access/Secret keys in AWS CLI, the location in which these credentials are stored is the same default location that Terrraform searches the credentials from.

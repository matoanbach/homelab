## Learning to destroy resources
- If you keep the infrastructure running, you will get charged for it.
- Hence it is important for us to also know on how we can delete the infrastructure resources created via terraform.

### Approach 1 - Destroy ALL
- `terraform destroy` allows us to destroy all the resource that are created within the folder.
### Approach 2 - Destroy targeted resources
- terraform destroy with `-target` flag allows us to destroy specific resource.
## Terrafrom destroy with target
- The `-target` option can be used to focus Terraform's attention on only a subset of resources
- Combination of `Resource Type` and `Local Resource Name`
```bash
terraform destroy -target aws_instance.ec2
```

| Resource Type     | Local Resource Name |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| aws_instance      | myec2               |
| github_repository | example             |

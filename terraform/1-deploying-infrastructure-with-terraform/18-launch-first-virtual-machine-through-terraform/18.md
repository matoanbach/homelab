- In-short, it's a name for a virtual server that you launch in AWS.

## Available Regions
- Cloud providers offer multiple regions in which we can create our resource.
- You need to decide the region in which Terraform would create the resource.

    - CPU
    - Memory
    - Storage
    - Operation System

# Providers and Resources
## Basics of Providers
- Terraform supports multiple providers
- Depending on what type of infrastructure we want to launch, we have to use appropriate providers accordingly.

### Provider Plugins
- A provider is a plugin that lets Terraform manage an external API
- When we run `terraform init`, plugins required for the provider are automatically downloaded and saved locally to a `.terraform` directory.

### Resource
- Resource block describes on or more infrastructure objects
- A resource block declares a resource of a givin type ("aws_instance") with a given local name ("myec2)
- Resource type and Name together serve as an identifier for a givin resource and so must be unique.
- Example:
    - `resource aws_instance`
    - `resource aws_alb`
    - `resource iam_user`
    - `resource digitalocean_droplet`

```python
resource "aws_instance" "myec2" {
    ami = "ami-082b5kasd12d1ad"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

### Point to Note
- You can only use the resource that are supported by a specific provider.
- In the below example, provider of Azure is used with resource of aws_instance

### Issues and Bugs with Providers
- A provider that is maintained by HashiCorp does not mean it has no bugs
- It can happen that there are inconsistencies from your output and things mentioned in documentation. You can raise issue at Provider page.

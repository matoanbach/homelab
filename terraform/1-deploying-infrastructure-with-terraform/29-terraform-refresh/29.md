## Understanding the Challenge
- Terraform can create an infrastructure based on configuration you specified.
- It can happen that the infrastructure gets modified manually.

## Solution
- The `terraform refresh` command will check the latest state of your infrastructure and update the state file accordingly.

## Points to Note
- You don't need to use this command, because Terraform automatically performs the same refreshing actions as a part of creating a plan in both the terraform plan and terraform apply commands.
- `terraform refresh` command in deprecated in new version of terraform.
- The `-refresh-only` option for terraform plan and terraform apply was introduced in Terraform `v0.15.4`

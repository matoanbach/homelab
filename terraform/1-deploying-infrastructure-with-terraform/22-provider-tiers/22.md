## Provider Maintainers
- There are 3 primary type of provider tiers in Terraform.

| Provider Tiers | Description                                                                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Official       | Owned and Maintained by HashiCorp                                                          |
| Partner        | Owned and Maintained by Technology Company that maintains direct partnership with HashCorp |
| Community      | Owned and Maintained by Individual Contributors                                            |

## Provider Namspace
- **Namespaces** are used to help users identify the organization or publisher responsible for the integration.

## Important Learning
- Terraform requires explicit source information for any providers that are not HashiCorp-maintained, using a new syntax in the required_providers nested block inside the terrafom configuration block

```tf
provider "aws" {
    region = "us-west"
    access_key = ""
    secret_key = ""
}
```

```tf
terraform {
    required_provider {
        digitalocean = {
            source = "digitalocean/digitalocean"
        }
    }
}

provider "digitalocean" {
    token = "PUT-YOUR-TOKEN-HERE"
}
```

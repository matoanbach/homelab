# Understanding the Basics
- There are two ways in which you can create and manage your infra:
    1. Manually approach
    2. Automation approach

## Basics of IaC
- Infrastrcure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processess.
```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Description: Simple EC2
Resources:
    WebAppInstance:
        Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
        Properties:
            ImageID: ami-079dk98ka812
            InstanceType: t2.micro
```

```python
resource "aws_instance" "myec2" {
    ami = "ami-079dk98ka812"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

## Benefits of Instructure As Code

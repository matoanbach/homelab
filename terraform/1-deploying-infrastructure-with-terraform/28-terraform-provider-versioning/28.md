# Provider Versioning
- Provider plugins are released separately from Terraform itself.
- They have different set of version numbers.

## Explicitly Setting Provider Version
- During terraform init, if version arguments is not specified, the most recent provider will be downloaded during initialization.
- For production use, you should constraint the acceptable provider versions via configuration, to ensure that new versions with breaking changes will not be automatically installed.
```json
terraform {
    required_providers {
        aws = {
            source = "hashicorp/aws"
            version = "~> 3.0"
        }
    }
}

provider "aws" {
    region = "us-east-1"
}
```

## Arguments for Specifying provider
- There are multiple ways for specifying the version of a provider
| Version Number Arugment | Description                       |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| >= 1.0                  | Greater than equal to the version |
| <= 1.0                  | Less than equal to the version    |
| ~> 2.0                  | Any version in the 2.X range      |
| >= 2.10, <= 2.30        | Any version between 2.10 and 2.30 |

## Dependency Lock File
- Terraform dependency lock file allows us to lock to a specific version of the provider.
- If a particular provider already has a selection recorded in the lock file, Terraform will always re-select that version for installation, even if a newer version has become available.
- You can override that behavior by adding the `-upgrade` option when you run `terraform init`

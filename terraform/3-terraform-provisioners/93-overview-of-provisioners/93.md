## Terraform Providers
- We have been using Terraform to create and manage resources for a specific provider.
- Organizations would want end-to-end solution for creation of infrastructure and configuring appropriate packages required for the application.

## Introducing Provisioners
- Provisioners are used to execute scripts on a local or remote machine as part of resource creation or destruction.
- Example: After VM is launched, install software package required for application.

## Types of Provisioners in Terraform
### `local-exec` provisioner
- The `local-exec` provisioner invokes a local executable after a resource is created.
- Example: After EC2 is launched, fetch the IP and store it in file server_ip.txt

### `remote-exec` provisioner
- `remote-exec` provisioners allow to invoke scripts or run commands directly on the remote server.
- Example: After EC2 is launched, install "apache" software

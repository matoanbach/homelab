## Sensitive Parameter
- By default, Terraform will show the values associated with defined attributes in the CLI output during plan, apply operations for most of the resources.
- We should design our Terraform code in such a way that no sensitive information is available and shown out of the box in CLI Output, Logs, etc.

## Basics of Sensitive Parameter
- Adding sensitive parameter ensures that you do not accidentally expose this data in CLI output, log output.

### Sensitive values and Output values
- If you try to reference sensitive value in output values, Terraform will immediately give you an error.
```
variable "sensitive_content" {
    sensitive = true
    default = "supersceret"
}

resource "local_file" "foo" {
    content = var.sensitive_content
    filename = "password.txt"
}

output "content" {
    value = local_file.foo.content
}
```
- If you still want sensitive content to be available in `output` of state file but should bot be visible in CLI output and logs, the following approach can be used.
- Sensitive parameter will NOT protect / redact information from State file.
- Various providers like AWS will automatically considers the password argument for any database instance as sensitive and will redact it as a sensitive value.

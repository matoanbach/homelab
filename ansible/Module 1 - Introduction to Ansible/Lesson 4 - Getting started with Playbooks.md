# 4.1 Using YAML to Write Playbooks
## Why playbooks
- Ad-hoc commands can be used to run one or a few tasks
- Ad-hoc commands are convenient to test, or when a complete managed infrastructure hasn't been set up yet
- Ansible playbooks are used to run multiple tasks against managed hosts in a scripted way
- In playbooks, one or multiple plays are started
  - Each play runs one or more tasks
  - In these tasks, different modules are used to perform the actual work
- Playbooks are written in YAML and have the .yml or .yaml extension

## Understanding YAML
- YAML is Yet Another Markup Language according to some
- According to others it stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language
- Anyway, it's an easy-to-read format to structure tasks/items that need to be created
- In YAML files, items are usign identation with white spaces to indicate the structure of data
- Data elements at the same level should have the same indentation
- Child items are indented more than the parent items
- There is no strict requirement about the number of spaces that should be used, but 2 is common

## Writing Your First Playbook
```yml
- name: deploy vsftpd
  hosts: ansible2
  tasks:
  - name: install vsftpd
    yum: name=vsftpd
  - name: enable vsftpd
    service: name=vsftpd enabled=true
  - name: create readme file
    copy:
        content: "free downloads for everybody"
        dest: /var/ftp/pub/README
```

# 4.2 Running Playbooks
## Running Your First Playbook
- Run `ansible-playbook vsftpd.yml` to run the playbook
- Notice that a successfuly run requires the inventory and become parameters to be set correctly, and also requires access to an inventory file
- The output of the `ansible-playbook` command will show what exactly has happened
- Playbooks should be idempotent, which means that running the same playbook again should lead to the same result
- Notice there is no easy way to undo changes made by a playbook

## Using ansible-navigator
- `ansible-navigator run -m stdout --pp never vsftpd.yml` will run the playbook using navigator
  - `-m stdout` will write output to STDOUT instead of using iterative mode
  - `--pp never` will not check for newer container images
- `ansible-navigator run --pp never vsftpd.yml` will run the playbook in iterative mode
  - Use the indicated numbers to get more details about each step
  - Use Esc to get out of any interface
  - Set `policy: missing` in `.ansible-navigator.yml` to avoid using the `--pp never` option
  - `~/.ansible-navigator.yml`
    ```yml
    ansible-navigator:
    execution-environment:
        image: ee-supported-rhel8:latest
        pull:
        policy: missing
    playbook-artifact:
        enable: false
    ```

# 4.3 Verifying Playbook Syntax
## Verifying Syntax
- `ansible-playbook --syntax-check vsftpd.yml` will perform a syntax check
- Use `-v[vvv]` to increase output verbosity
  - `-v` will show task results
  - `-vv` will show task results and task configuration
  - `-vvv` also shows information about connections to managed hosts
  - `-vvvv` adds information about plug-ins, users used to run scripts, and names of scripts that are executed
- Use `ansible-navigator run [--pp never] -m stdout vsftpd.yml --syntax-check` to check a syntax check with navigator


# 4.4 Using Multiple-Play Playbooks
## Understanding Plays
- A playbook can contain multiple plays
- A play is a series of tasks that are executed against selected hosts from the inventory, using specific credentials
- Using multiple plays allows running tasks on different hosts, using different credentials from the same playbook
- Withing a play defintion, escalation parameters can be defined:
  - `remote_user`: the name of the remote user
  - `become`: to enable or disable privilege escalation
  - `become_method`: to allow using an alternative escalation solution
  - `become_user`: the target user used for privilege escalation
- When these parameters are used at a more specific level, they will overwrite the more generic setting

# Lesson 4 Lab: Writing a Playbook
- Write a playbook that installs the httpd package on ansible2
- Ensure that it is started and that the firewall is opened to allow access to it
- Also create a file /var/www/html/index.html with some welcome text
- Lastly, write a playbook that will undo all modifications

```yml
---
- name: Playbook for lab4
  hosts: ansible2
  tasks:
    - name: install httpd
      dnf:
        name:
          - httpd
          - firewalld
        state: latest

    - name: start httpd
      service:
        name: httpd
        enabled: yes
        state: started

    - name: start firewalld
      service:
        name: firewalld
        enabled: yes
        state: started

    - name: set up firewall for httpd
      firewalld:
        service: http
        permanent: true
        state: enabled
        immediate: true

    - name: write to index.html
      copy:
        content: "welcome text"
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html
```

```yml
---
- name: undo lab4 playbook
  hosts: ansible2
  tasks:
  - name: file index.html is removed
    file:
      name: /var/www/html/index.html
      state: absent

  - name: delete httpd package
    dnf:
      name: httpd
      state: absent
```

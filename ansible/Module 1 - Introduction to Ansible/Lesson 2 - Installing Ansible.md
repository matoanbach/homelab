# 2.1 Understanding What to install
- Install 3 VM's, using RHEL (recommended)  or CentOS Stream
  - control.example.local (Server with GUI)
  - ansible1.example.local (minimal install)
  - ansible2.example.local (minimal install)
- The latest version of RHEL can be obtained for free from `https://developers.redhat.com`
- The machines require Internet access
- Clone git repository: `git clone https://github.com/sandervanvugt/rhce9`

## Required Lab
- The _control node_ is where you install Ansible
- For RHCE 9, you'll install on top of RHEL 9 (preferred) or CentOS Stream
- Make sure a fixed IP address is set up, as well as a hostname
- The _managed nodes_ are managed by Ansible
- Managed nodes can be anything: servers running RHEL, but also other Linux distributions, Windows, Network Devices, and much more
- For RHCE 9, you'll need 2 managed nodes pre-installed with RHEL 9 or CentOS Stream
- Ensure host name lookup is configured, `/etc/hosts` is good enough

# 2.2 Understanding Required Components
- To use Ansible, the following is needed:
  - Host name resolution to address managed hosts by name
  - Python on all nodes
  - SSH running on the managed servers
  - A dedicated user account with sudo privileges
  - Optional: SSH jeys to make logging in esier
  - An inventory to identify managed nodes on the control node
  - Optional: an ansible.cfg to specify default parameters

# 2.3 Installing Ansible on the Control Node
1. On the control node: use `sudo subscription-manager repos --list` to verify the name of the latest available repository
2. Use `sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms` to enable the repository
3. `sudo subscription-manager repos --enable ansible-automation-platform-2.2-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms`
4. Use `sudo dnf install ansible-core -y` to install the Ansible software
5. Use `sudo dnf install ansible-navigator -y` to install Ansible Navigator
6. `ansible --version` to verify

# 2.4 Using Ansible to Set up Managed Nodes
```bash
cat >> inventory >> EOF
    ansible1
    ansible2
    EOF

ssh ansible1 # to create a finger print 
ssh ansible2 # to create a finger print
ansible -i inventory all -u student -k -b -K -m user -a "name=ansible"
ansible -i inventory all -u student -k -b -K -m shell -a "echo password | passwd --stdin ansible"
ssh-keygen # (for user student, as well as for user ansible)
for i in ansible1 ansible2; do ssh-copy-id $i; done # (user student & ansible)
ansible -i inventory all -u ansible -b -m command -a "ls -l /root" -K
ansible -i inventory all -u student -k -b -m shell -a 'echo "ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL"' > /etc/sudoers.d/ansible
```

# 2.5 Managing Static Inventory
## Managin Static Inventory
- In a minimal form, a static inventory is a list of host names and/or IP addresses that can be managed by Ansible
- Hosts can be grouped in inventory to make it easy to address multiple hosts at once
- A host can be a member of multiple groups
- Nested groups are also available
- It is common to work with project-based inventory files
- Variables can be set from the inventory file - but this is deprecated practice.
- Ranges can be used:
  - server[1:20] matches server1 up to server20
  - 192.168.[4:5].[0:255] matches two full class C subnets

## Inventory Files Locations
- `/etc/ansible/hosts` is the default inventory
- Alternative inventory location can be specified through the ansible.cfg configuration file
- Or use the `-i inventory` option to specify the location of the inventory file to use
- It is common practice to put the inventory file in the current project director option to specify the location of the inventory file to use
- It is common practice to put the inventory file in the current project directory

## Static Inventory Example
```yaml
[webservers]
web[1:9].example.com
web12.example.com

[fileservers]
file1.example.com
file2.example.com

[servers:children]
webservers
fileservers
```

## Host Groups Usage
- Functional host groups
  - web
  - lamp
- Regional host groups
  - europe
  - africa
- Staging host groups
  - test
  - development
  - production

## Testing Inventory
- `ansible -i inventory all --list-hosts`
- `ansible -i inventory file --list-hosts`
- `ansible-navigator inventory -i inventory -m stdout --list`

# 2.6 Creating ansible.cfg
- Different connection settings can be specified in ansible.cfg
- If the file `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` exists, it will be used
- If an ansible.cfg file exists in the current project directory, that will be used and all settings in `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` are ignored
- Use `ansible --version` to see which ansible.cfg will be used
- If a playbook contains settings, they will override the settings from ansible.cfg

## Understanding ansible.cfg
- Settings in ansible.cfg are organized in two (or more) sections
  - `[defaults]` sets default settings
  - `[privilege_escalation]` specifies how Ansible runs commands on managed hosts
- The following settings are used:
  - `inventory` specifies the path to the inventory file
  - `remote_user` is the name of the user that logs in on the remote hosts
  - `ask_pass` specifies whether or not to prompt for a password
  - `become` indicates if you want to automatically switch to the become_user
  - `become_user` specifies the target remote user

## Connecting to the Remote Hosts
- The default protocol to connect to the remote host is SSH
  - Key-based authentication is the common approach, but password-based authentication is possible as well
  - Use `ssh-keygen` to generate a public/private SSH key pair, and next use `ssh-copy-id` to copy the public key over to the managed hosts
- Other connection methods are available, to manage Windows for instance, ise `ansible_conection: winrm` and set `ansible_port: 5986`

## Escalating Privilegs
- `sudo` is the default machanism for privilege escalation
- Password-less escalation is OK on the RHCE exam, but insured and not recommended in real world
- To set up password-less sudo, create a drop-in file in `/etc/sudoers.d/` with the following contents:
  - `ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`
- To securely escalate privileges using passwords, add the following to `/etc/sudoers`:
  - `Defaults timestamp_type=global,timestamp_timeout=60` 

## Understanding Localhost Connections
- Ansible has an implicit localhost entry to run Ansible commands on the localhost
- When connecting to localhost, the default `become` settings are not used, but the account that ran the Ansible command is used
- Ensure this account has been configured with the appropriate `sudo` privileges

# 2.7 ansible-navigator Settings
- After installing `ansible-navigator`, it needs additional setup
- To provide this setup, you'll need to login to a container registry
- This is because `ansible-navigator` uses an execution environment, which is based on a container image

## Demo: ansible-navigator intial setup
- `sudo dnf install ansible-navigator`
- `ansible-navigator --version`
- `podman login registry.redhat.io`
- `podman pull registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-22/ee-supported-rhel8:latest`
- `ansible-navigator images`
- `ansible-navigator inventory -i inventory file --list`

## Managin Settings for ansible-navigator
- Settings for `ansible-navigator` can be specified in a configuration file
- Define `~/.ansible-navigator.yml` for generic settings
- If an `ansible-navigator.yml` file is found in the current project directory, this will have higher priority
- Recommended settings:
  - `pull.policy: missing` will only contact the container registry if no container image has been pulled yet
  - `playbook-artifact.enable: false` required when a playbook prompts for a password

## ansible-navigator.yml example
```yaml
ansible-navigator:
    execution-environment:
        image: ee-supported-rhel8:latest
        pull:
            policy: missing
    playbook-artifact:
        enable: false
```

# Lesson 2 Lab: Setting up a Managed Environment
- Finalize setting up the Ansible managed environment and ensure you setup meets the following requirements:
  - User Ansible is used for all management tasks on managed hosts
  - Inventory is set up
  - Ansible.cfg is configured for sudo privilege escalation
  - SSH key-based login is configured

```yaml
    1  ssh ansible1
    2  ssh ansible2
    3  clear
    4  cat >> inventory << EOF
ansible1
ansible2
EOF

    5  ansible all -m command -a "ls -l /root"
    6  cat inventory 
    7  ansible --version
    8  ansible -i inventory all -m c command -a "ls -l /root"
    9  ansible -i inventory all -m  command -a "ls -l /root"
   10* 
   11  ssh ansible@ansible1
   12  ansible -i inventory -m command -a "ls -l /root"
   13  ansible -i inventory all -m command -a "ls -l /root"
   14  ssh-keygen 
   15  for i in ansible1 ansible2; do ssh-copy-id $i; done
   16  clear
   17  ansible -i inventory all -m command -a "ls -l /root"
```

- ansible.cfg:
    ```yaml
    [defaults]
    inventory = inventory
    remote_user = ansible
    ask_pass = false

    [privilege_escalation]
    become = true
    become_method = sudo
    become_user = root
    become_pass = false
    ```

## 1.3 Getting Familiar with the Red Hat Family

- One of these is Fedora, a free community distribution that is sponsored by Red Hat
- Mature packges from Fedora are included in CentOS Stream
- CentOS Stream is the upstream project for RHEL, where community developers can participate and contribute new software
- RHEL is derived from CentOS Stream and offers an enterprise Linux distribution with support options

### Fedora
- Fedora is a community project sponsored by Red Hat
- The focus in Fedora is on the latest developments, and not so much on stability
- Fedora has a 12- to 18-month lifecycle and no support options are available
- A new version is typicall released every six-months

### CentOS Stream
- CentOS Stream is the upstream development platform for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- It includes software from the Fedora project that has reached a stable state
- It has an expected lifecycle of five years
- Due to its ever-evolving nature, CentOS Stream is not a recommended distribution to use in production environments

### RHEL
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux is the supported Linux distribution that is offered for use by organizations
- It has a lifecycle of 10 years
- It offers support on the software
- It integrates in the Red Hat product family, where additional expertise, security, certification, and monitoring can be offered
- Unsupported free usage is offered for up to 16 instances of Red Hat Enterprise Linux

### Rocky Linux and Alma Linux
- Before 2019, CentOS was a free alternative to Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where all Red Hat proprietary elements were removed
- Nowadays, CentOS Stream is the only version of CentOS and it serves as upstream to RHEL
- Rocky Linux was created by the original founders of the CentOS project
- Alma Linux was created by CloudLinux
- As Red Hat offers up to 16 instances of RHEL for free, the need for free distributions like Alma and Rocky is not as big as it used to be
